For this assignment, I choose to use the state drug utilization dataset due to its presence of multiple datatypes. 
First, I looked at the existing data types and the characteristics of each field.
Next, I made the non-categorical data type of int64 (Year) into an object data type (Year_Object). 
I choose year because even though it was an int data type, the field only has one value. 
Finally, I choose to change the suppression used field from a boolean data type into a string.
